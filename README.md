OMG, Last Bullet. Still having a hard time– my mind’s whirling, you know? Sitting here on this bench, half covered in popcorn crumbs – seriously, it’s like they multiply when you’re not looking. Back hurts from those theater seats, felt like sitting on a giant rock that’s slowly growing sharper.

Totally forgot what the opening scene was, like poof, out of my mind, but this one shot where, man, bullets were flying like angry bees, just a cacophony of metal zipping through the air. Felt like my heart was synced directly with the gunfire, every shot an electric jolt. That villain dude, the way he smiled like a crocodile in a business suit, ugh, made my skin crawl.

> Then there was this bizarre, poetic monologue about life and death while a cat walked across the top of a piano. So random, but kind of genius. The protagonist, what's-his-name, had this look on his face, a mix of brooding hero and someone who just stepped on gum.

I swear, there was a bullet time sequence where time slowed down to molasses dripping, almost heard a guy behind me mouth whoa. Theatre so loud, like each explosion and car chase was trying to one-up a thunderstorm. The ultimate showdown – eghh, some logic went out the window there, like a flying squirrel trying to be a penguin. Random pigeons flying past during conversations – someone went overboard with the bird budget.

Wasn't there a part with an abandoned warehouse, always with warehouses, right? It’s almost as mandatory as popcorn, which by the way, is all over my jacket. Someone said I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , but dude, you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in a theater. Experiencing it here, hard seats and popcorn dust included, that’s the real deal.

Did I mention the soundtrack? Like a roller coaster of violins and electric guitars, as if Beethoven had a wild night in Vegas. Halfway through, thought I was gonna hum along like it was the ultimate brain worm.

anyway, can't even remember how it ended, or maybe that’s the point? life is just a series of near-missed memories, explosions, and... pigeons.

    return dazed
